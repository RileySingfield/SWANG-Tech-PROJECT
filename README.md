# Build & Run Instructions

## Prerequisites
Before building and running the project, ensure you have:
- **Java 17+** installed and set in your system's PATH
- **Maven** installed (`mvn -version` should confirm this)

## Building the Project
There are various different ways to run our project 

### Option 1 - Run with maven 
For development or testing:

```bash
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

### Option 2 -  Run the Fat JAR
Build the project, first: 
```sh
mvn clean package
```

Then run with: 
```sh
java -jar target/BeautyCatalog-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

This will clean, compile, package, and run the Java application.
